# Dissecting-night-club-profits-report
A project involving an analysis of profits from two nightclubs.

The project this report was written for wanted me to 

* Use summaries to explore profits at each of the superclubs
* Find ranges of plausible values for the averagenightly profit at each club.
* Find that if picked at random one Club made more profit than another 
* Use hypthosies test to work out if assumption made by a analysts held true or if there was any issues.

Then finally have me compare each club using my findings
